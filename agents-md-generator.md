# Prompt: Generate AGENTS.md Using Vector DB + Code Search

## Context
This codebase is indexed in Qdrant vector database using Nomic embeddings for semantic search.

## Generation Strategy

**Use Vector DB (Qdrant) to understand and discover:**
- Business domain and use cases
- Architecture patterns and design decisions  
- Common workflows and conventions
- Critical business rules from code

**Use Serena MCP to verify and locate:**
- Exact file paths and structure
- Specific class/method names for examples
- Code organization details

---

## SECTION 1: OVERVIEW (Use Vector DB + Serena)

**Step 1: Use Vector DB to understand the project**

Query Qdrant with these semantic searches (limit 10 results each):
```
1. "What is the main purpose of this system?"
2. "What business problem does this solve?"
3. "What type of application is this?"
4. "What technologies and frameworks are used?"
5. "What domain or industry is this for?"
```

**Step 2: Use Serena to verify structure**

Use Serena MCP to:
- Confirm actual tech stack (check build files, dependencies)
- Verify project type (find main entry points)

**Generate:**

**Project Name:** [Actual project name from repository]

**Purpose:** [One sentence from vector DB results]

**Type:** [e.g., Microservice, REST API, Web App, CLI Tool - from vector DB + Serena verification]

**Tech Stack:** [List key technologies found via vector DB, verified with Serena checking build files]

**Domain:** [Business domain identified from vector DB]

```
1. "What are the main business use cases?"
2. "What problems do users solve with this system?"
3. "What are the key workflows?"
4. "What business operations are supported?"
```

Limit: 10 results per query

**Step 2: Identify critical business rules**

Query Qdrant:
```
1. "What are critical business rules and validations?"
2. "What compliance or regulatory requirements exist?"
3. "What must never be violated in the business logic?"
4. "What are the most important constraints?"
5. "What security or privacy rules are enforced?"
```

Limit: 10 results per query

**Generate:**

### Core Business Use Cases

List 5-7 main use cases discovered from vector search:
- Use case name and description
- Why it's important
- Key requirements

### CRITICAL BUSINESS RULES

> These rules MUST NEVER be violated.

List 5-10 critical rules found in code:

For each rule:
1. **Rule name and description**
2. **Why it exists** (found from comments/documentation)
3. **Where enforced** (use Serena to verify exact locations)
4. **Violation impact** (from vector search understanding)

## SECTION 3: STRUCTURE (Use Serena + Vector DB)

**Step 1: Get actual directory structure**

Use Serena MCP to:
- List main directories
- Show actual file organization
- Identify where different code types live

**Step 2: Understand organization patterns**

Query Qdrant:
```
"How is the code organized and why?"
"What are the layers and their purposes?"
"What naming conventions are used?"
```

Limit: 5 results

**Generate:**

### Directory Organization

Explain why this architecture (from vector DB understanding).

### Key Architectural Patterns

Identify 2-4 patterns with examples:

For each pattern:
- **Pattern name** [from vector DB]
- **Where used** [verify with Serena MCP - actual file paths]
- **Why used** [from vector DB understanding]
- **Example location** [from Serena]

### Technology Choices

For major technologies:
- **What it is**
- **Why chosen** [from vector DB or git history]
- **How used** [from vector DB patterns]
- **Important constraints** [from vector DB]

## SECTION 5: HOW TO GET THINGS DONE (Generic + Repository Examples)

### 5.1 Finding Codes

**IMPORTANT: Tool Selection Strategy**

Document this clearly for daily usage:

```markdown
### Choose the Right Search Tool

| What You're Looking For | Tool to Use | Why |
|------------------------|-------------|-----|
| Exact string, method, class name | Serena MCP or grep | Precise, few results (3-10) |
| Code structure, references | Serena MCP | AST-aware, understands code |
| Semantic/conceptual questions | Vector DB (limit 5-10) | Finds related code by meaning |
| Configuration values | grep/ripgrep | Fast text search |

### When to Use Vector DB (Qdrant):

✅ **GOOD for learning and exploration:**
- "How do we handle authentication?"
- "Show examples of error handling patterns"
- "What are the common validation approaches?"
- "How does the approval workflow work?"
- "What integration patterns exist?"

**IMPORTANT: Always limit to 5-10 results**

❌ **BAD for exact searches (use Serena instead):**
- "Find class EmailService" → Use Serena
- "Find method sendEmail" → Use Serena
- "Find string 'email_tracker'" → Use grep
- "Find all calls to processPayment" → Use Serena

### Why This Matters:

**The 189k token problem:**
- Vector DB for exact search = 50 results = 189k tokens ❌
- Serena for exact search = 5 results = 10k tokens ✅

**Token Budget Guidelines:**

| Task Complexity | Target Tokens | Tool Choice |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Simple (find + edit method) | 5-20k | Serena/grep only |
| Medium (understand pattern + implement) | 20-50k | Vector DB (limit 5) + Serena |
| Complex (learn system + refactor) | 50-100k | Vector DB (limit 10) + Serena |
```

### 5.2 Adding / Deleting / Editing Codes

[Copy generic content from previous universal prompt - Sections on EDITING, ADDING, DELETING]

**Enhancement: Add Vector DB use case**

```markdown
#### Using Vector DB to Understand Before Changing

**When adding similar functionality:**

Step 1: Find examples with Vector DB
Query: "How are [similar features] implemented?"
Limit: 5 results
Review: Understand the patterns

Step 2: Find exact locations with Serena
Use Serena to locate specific files mentioned in vector results

Step 3: Follow the pattern
Implement using discovered patterns
```

### 5.3 Common Tasks - How To

**Step 1: Discover common tasks**

Query Qdrant:
```
1. "What are common development tasks?"
2. "How to add new features?"
3. "How to integrate external services?"
4. "What do developers frequently modify?"
```

Limit: 10 results

**Step 2: Document with Serena verification**

For each task, provide:
- Step-by-step instructions (from vector DB)
- Actual file paths (from Serena)
- Code examples (from Serena)

**Generate 3-5 common tasks based on vector DB findings**

## SECTION 6: MCP TOOLS

### 6.1 Serena MCP

[Copy generic Serena content from previous prompt]

**Add this critical section:**

```markdown
### Serena vs Vector DB

**Use Serena when you know what you're looking for:**
- Exact class/method/variable names
- All references to a specific element
- Code structure and inheritance
- Finding definitions

**Use Vector DB when you're exploring:**
- Understanding concepts
- Finding similar patterns
- Learning how something works
- Discovering related code
```

### 6.2 Sequential Thinking MCP

[Copy generic Sequential Thinking content]

### 6.3 Git MCP

[Copy generic Git content]

### 6.4 Vector Database (Qdrant with Nomic Embeddings)

**NEW SECTION - Add this:**

```markdown
### 6.4 Vector Database (Qdrant)

**Purpose:** Semantic code search for understanding concepts, patterns, and relationships.

**When to Use:**
- Learning how the system works
- Finding examples of patterns
- Understanding design decisions
- Exploring related functionality
- Discovering what's possible

**When NOT to Use:**
- Finding exact class/method names (use Serena)
- Locating specific strings (use grep)
- Getting all references (use Serena)
- Finding file paths (use Serena)

**Usage Examples:**

✅ **GOOD USES (Semantic Understanding):**

"How does this system handle authentication?"
→ Limit: 5-10 results
→ Returns: Related authentication code patterns

"Show me examples of error handling"
→ Limit: 5 results
→ Returns: Various error handling approaches

"What are common validation patterns?"
→ Limit: 5 results
→ Returns: Different validation implementations

"How does the bulk email workflow work?"
→ Limit: 10 results
→ Returns: Related workflow components

❌ **BAD USES (Exact Search - causes token bloat):**

"Find EmailService class"
→ Returns: 50+ results with "Email" or "Service" ❌
→ Use Serena instead: exact match ✅

"Find email_tracker database operations"
→ Returns: 50+ results mentioning email or tracking ❌
→ Use Serena/grep instead: 5 exact matches ✅

**Critical Rules:**

1. **Always limit results to 5-10 maximum**
   - More results = more tokens
   - Quality over quantity

2. **Never use for exact searches**
   - Exact names → Serena
   - Exact strings → grep
   - This prevents the 189k token problem

3. **Use for learning, not locating**
   - Learning: "How does X work?" → Vector DB ✅
   - Locating: "Where is X defined?" → Serena ✅

4. **Refine if results are poor**
   - Too broad: "code" → Too specific: "error handling in payment service"
   - Adjust query to be more specific

**Best Practices:**

- Start broad, then narrow with Serena
- Use Vector DB for discovery phase
- Switch to Serena for implementation phase
- Combine both: Vector DB (understand) → Serena (locate)

**Example Workflow:**

```
Task: Add rate limiting to email sending

Step 1 - Understand (Vector DB):
Query: "How is rate limiting implemented?"
Limit: 5 results
Result: Understand existing patterns

Step 2 - Locate (Serena):
"Use Serena to find RateLimiter class"
Result: Exact file location

Step 3 - Implement:
Follow discovered pattern in exact location

Token usage: 15k (Vector DB: 10k, Serena: 5k) ✅
vs 189k if used Vector DB for exact search ❌
```
```

## SECTION 7: DO's

[Copy generic DO's from previous prompt]

**Add this:**

```markdown
**Use Vector DB Wisely**
- Limit results to 5-10 maximum
- Use for understanding, not locating
- Switch to Serena for exact searches
- Be specific in semantic queries
```

---

## SECTION 8: DON'Ts

[Copy generic DON'Ts from previous prompt]

**Add this:**

```markdown
**Don't Misuse Vector Database**
- Don't use for exact name searches (causes 50+ results)
- Don't exceed 10 result limit (token bloat)
- Don't use when Serena is more appropriate
- Don't use for finding specific files/lines
```

---

## TOKEN EFFICIENCY QUICK REFERENCE

**Tool Selection Decision Tree:**

```
Do you know the exact name/string?
├─ YES → Use Serena MCP or grep (5-20k tokens)
└─ NO → Need to understand/explore?
    ├─ YES → Use Vector DB, limit 5-10 (10-20k tokens)
    └─ NO → Ask clarifying question first

Are you getting too many results?
├─ Vector DB returning 50+ → Switch to Serena ✅
└─ Serena returning 50+ → Refine scope/query
```

**Common Mistakes:**

| Mistake | Token Cost | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Vector DB for "find EmailService" | 189k ❌ | Serena: 5k ✅ |
| Loading entire files | 100k ❌ | Load methods only: 10k ✅ |
| No result limits on Vector DB | 200k ❌ | Limit to 5-10: 15k ✅ |
| Searching whole codebase | 150k ❌ | Scope to directory: 20k ✅ |
